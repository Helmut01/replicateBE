- Add swR to the result data.frame (for recalculation of the expanded limits).
  Currently only in the txt-file.
  Shall we add sWT as well?
- Picky (@THX to Shuanghe):
  Acc. to the NIST’s “Typefaces for Symbols in Scientific Manuscripts”
  (https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf):
  ‘Symbols used as subscripts and superscripts are roman if descriptive.’
  Therefore, in the man-pages and the vignette e.g.,
    HTML:  \out{<em>CV</em><sub>wR</sub>}
    LaTeX: \eqn{CV_\textrm{wR}}
