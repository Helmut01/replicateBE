    Simulated with \ifelse{html}{\out{CV<sub>wT</sub>}}{\eqn{CV_{wT}}} = \ifelse{html}{\out{CV<sub>wR</sub>}}{\eqn{CV_{wR}}} = 45\%, \ifelse{html}{\out{CV<sub>bT</sub>}}{\eqn{CV_{bT}}} = \ifelse{html}{\out{CV<sub>bR</sub>}}{\eqn{CV_{bR}}} = 100\% GMR 0.90. 42 subjects.\cr
    Balanced (21 subjects in each of the sequences) and complete (no missing data). No outliers.\cr
    A data frame with 126 observations on the following 5 variables:

        \tabular{ll}{
        \code{subject} \tab a factor with 42 levels: 1, 2, \ldots, 42\cr

        \code{PK} \tab a numeric vector of pharmacokinetic responses acceptable for reference-scaling (generally \ifelse{html}{\out{C<sub>max</sub>}}{\eqn{C_{max}}})\cr
        \code{logPK} \tab a numeric vector of the natural logarithms of {\code{PK}}

  }
}

\note{
In software sequences and treatments are ranked in lexical order. Hence, executing \code{str()} or \code{summary()} will show \code{sequence} as \code{"RTR", "TRR"} and \code{treatment} as \code{"R", "T"}. In \acronym{BE} -- by convention -- sequences are ordered with \code{T} first. The library follows this convention.\cr
This partial replicate design is also known as the \sQuote{extra-reference design}. Since the Test is not administered in all periods, lacking period effects must be assumed. In the presence of \emph{true} period effects the treatment comparison will be biased. Hence, this design is not recommended.
