      A data frame with 126 observations on the following 5 variables:
      \tabular{ll}{
      \code{subject} \tab a factor with 42 levels: 1, 2, \ldots, 42\cr
      \code{period} \tab a factor with 3 levels: 1, 2, 3\cr
      \code{sequence} \tab a factor with 2 levels: TRR, RTR\cr
      \code{treatment} \tab a factor with 2 levels: T, R\cr
      \code{PK} \tab a numeric vector of pharmacokinetic responses acceptable for reference-scaling (generally \ifelse{html}{\out{C<sub>max</sub>}}{\eqn{C_{max}}})\cr
      \code{logPK} \tab a numeric vector of the natural logarithms of {\code{PK}}

      Balanced (21 subjects in each of the sequences) and complete (no missing data). No outliers.

\note{
In software sequences and treatments are ranked in lexical order. Hence, executing \code{str()} or \code{summary()} will show \code{sequence} as \code{"RTR", "TRR"} and \code{treatment} as \code{"R", "T"}. In \acronym{BE} -- by convention -- sequences are ordered with \code{T} first. The library follows this convention.\cr
This partial replicate design is also known as the \sQuote{extra-reference design}. Since the Test is not administered in all periods, lacking period effects must be assumed. In the presence of a \emph{true} period effect the treatment comparison will be biased. Hence, this design is not recommended.
