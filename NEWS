Version 1.0.5.9000
Published on GitHub 2017-06-25
    - Added data set 22 for the extra-reference design (RTR|TRR).
    - Bug-fix: method.B(option=1) output to file.
    - Lazy data: true in DESCRIPTION allows direct access of objects
      within data().
    - Changed the names of result files reflecting the Method used
      rather the internals (lme/lmer).
    - Changed TRR.RTT to RTT.TRR for consistancy (R always first).
    - In PowerTOST T is always first. The order is only relevant in
      method.A(..., adjust=TRUE) and an unbalanced RTR|TRT-design.
      In this case the order of subjects/sequence is reversed in
      calling scABEL(...,  n=rev(ret$Sub.Seq)). THX to Detlew for
      discovering this bug.
    - method.A(adjust=TRUE) assesses additionally the TIE based on
      the recalculated CVwR (if applicable).
    - Man pages reworked. [DL]
    - Identify internal data sets based on their attribute. Uses now
      info.data(). THX to Detlew. which.data() removed.
    - Introduced aliases in man pages for all data sets. Otherwise,
      warnings in CHECK about undocumented objects.
    - Added Data Set 23 as an example of a 4-period 4-sequence design
      (although not recommended by the FDA).
    - Bug-fix in CV.calc(..., ole=TRUE) if an outlier is detected not
      in both methods (studentized, standardized).
    - Changed the lexical order of sequences (T before R) in conformity
      with PowerTOST and Q&A DSII.
    - Changed TRTR|TRRT|RTTR|RTRT to TRTR|RTRT|TRRT|RTTR. More logical
      (stacking sequences of the other full replicates). Adapted
      scripts and man pages accordingly.
    - New function info.design(). Sorts sequences according to the
      preferred order and throws a message if the design is untested.
    - Bug-fix: Adapt the No. of subjects / sequence and No. of missings /
      sequence to the reordered sequences in get.data(). Calculation was
      correct but output in result-files wrong. TODO: Check all man pages.
    - Argument 'fence' for box plots instead of the hard-coded 3 as a
      multiplier for IQR. The default 1.5 in most (all?) software packages
      detects /a lot/ of outliers. 3 seems to be liberal. 2 is a compromise.
    - Argument 'set' can be an empty string "" to support reading from
      CSV-files. Only required for XLS (the name of the sheet) now.

Version 1.0.5
Released to collaborators 2017-06-24
    - Unified data sets, updated man-pages, and changed which.data():
      'ref' => 'rds'. Warnings in CHECK: 'rdsXX' not found.
    - Still unresolved: method.B(option=1) can't print to file with internal
      data.
Version 1.0.4
Released to collaborators 2017-06-23
    - Working on \data and the documentation. All data sets observe the
      pattern 'refXX.rda' in order to come last in the man-page.
    - Modified imports in NAMESPACE. [DL]
    - method.B(): Changed print(anova.lm(modB)) to print(anova(modB)). [DL]
    - Bug fix: If verbose=TRUE the anova was not shown in ABE().
    - Q: A user calls foo(path.in=path.in, ...) but the variable 'path.in'
      is not defined before. Gives "object 'path.in' not found in CV.calc()"
      line 13. Line 10 does not help.
    - Bug-fix: If the specified file is not found in 'path.in' the file
      browser opens. Q: How to start the search at the home folder? Lines 70/71
      and 92/93 in get.data(R) don't work as intended.
    - Added argument 'data=NULL' (default NULL) to top-level functions.
    - F.i. data(ref02) followed by print(ABE(details=T, print=F, data=data))
      works. Problems: The descripive header (variable 'descr') doesn't
      exist in the internal data set as well as its name. Hence, the same
      with the default print=TRUE in all functions gives an error.
      Stupid: The data set must be chosen outside of the function call.
      foo(data=data(ref02)) gives an error.
    - Removed DS.xls and adapted man-examples accordingly. CRAN policy: Data
      sets should not be larger than 1 MB. BTW, why is the zip so much larger
      than the tarball? Before removing DS.xls their sizes were similar.
    - Changed the default variable separator from ";" to "," (more common).
    - Replaced subset() in get.data() and CV.calc() by direct assignment.
      No need for the hacks any more.
    - Removed CV.calc from NAMESPACE. man-page not needed any more. THX to
      Detlew.
    - New function which.data(): returns data.frame 'id' of checksum (MD5),
      file "DS", set ("01", ... "XX"), ref ("refXX"), descr.
      Used in get.data() to obtain required variables of the currently
      attached internal data set based on its MD5-checksum.
    - Bug-fix: If 'descr' was read from an external file and the code stopped
      for data not matching the id in which.data().
    - Warning in man-pages: Header must not contain the word 'subject'.
Version 1.0.3
Released to collaborators and beta-testers 2016-06-19
    - Added function ABE() for conventional (unscaled) ABE.
    - Renamed package from "ABEL" to "replicateBE".
    - Changed enf.info(): If path(s) NULL, show the user's home
      folder in the lines 'Input from' and 'Output to'.
    - Added \data\ref01.rda (already factorized data.frame) and man-page.
Version 1.0.2
Released to collaborators and beta-tester Mahmoud Teaima 2016-06-19
    - If 'path.in' and/or 'path.out' not given or not existing, the
      user's home folder will be used. Updated the man pages accordingly.
    - New argument 'plot.bxp'. If FALSE (default) the boxplot will be
      shown in the default graphics device. If TRUE the boxplot will be
      saved in PNG format to 'path.out'. Argument 'ask' is also observed.
Version 1.0.1
Released to collaborators and beta-tester Mahmoud Teaima 2016-06-18
    - Improved man-pages. Added an example comparing Method B with
      Method A.
    - Changed get.data(): 'path.out' only required if print=TRUE.
      Default 'path.out' in method.A() and method.B() NULL.
    - Changed in get.data() name of file from "_results_" to "_ABEL_".
    - Removed lme4 from listed packages in env.inf(). lmer, summary,
      and anova obtained from lmerTest.
    - Argument 'ask' (default FALSE). If TRUE and a result file
      already exists, the user is asked whether it should be overwritten.
Version 1.0.0
Released to collaborators and beta-tester Mahmoud Teaima 2016-06-16
    - method.A(): Changed
        lm(foo ~ subject + period + treatment, data)
      to the subject decomposition acc. to the Q&A document
        lm(foo ~ sequence + subject%in%sequence + period + treatment, data)
      Note: PE, MSE, DF identical to the simple model, but less confusing
      if the ANOVA is shown (verbose=TRUE). [suggested by Mahmoud Teaima]
    - Functions env.info(), get.data(), CV.calc(), method.A(), method.B()
      stand-alone in order to support package-building.
    - The former variable 'path' (used for in- /and/ output) substituted
      by variables 'path.in' and 'path.out'.
    - Housekeeping routine removed.
    - Simplified output in method.A() if adjust=TRUE.
    - First version of package built.

Version 0.95
Released to collaborators 2016-06-11
    - Vector of na-strings supported since v1.0.0 of package 'readxl'.
      Throws a message if the installed version is <1.0.0. Is there a
      method to /automatically/ update a package?
    - Reading xls(x)-files corrected. Converts the tibble-object to a
      data.frame.
    - Bug in print corrected. Line-endings CRLF (Windows), LF (UNIXes),
      CR (MacOS). Tested on Windows [HS] and on macOS Sierra 10.12.5
      (THX to Mahmoud Teaima, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University).
    - y-axis in boxplot symmetrical around zero. I think that this is
      more informative than the default.
    - Cosmetics: List in env.inf() only the packages which are used by
      the respective functions.

Version 0.94
Released to collaborators and beta-tester Mahmoud Teaima 2016-06-01
    - Added optional outlier assessment (ola=TRUE) for the reference.
      Defaults to ola=FALSE.
      Studentized and standardized residuals are calculated and shown in
      boxplots.
      Note: Only standardized res. are available in Phoenix WinNonlin.
    - If outlier(s) detected, CVwR is recalculated and BE is /additionally/
      assessed based on the new limits.
    - Cosmetics: Moved DF and alpha up after the number of subjects.
      More logic to me.
    - Outlier analysis to console if verbose=TRUE.

Version 0.93
Released to collaborators 2016-12-16
    - Restored the evaluation by lmer/lmerTest from v0.83 to support
      comparing the performance of packages. Wish of DL.
    - Moved check for trailing '/' in the path-argument from method.A()/
      method.B() to get.data().
    - Added argument 'verbose' (default FALSE) to method.A()/method.B()
      to support detailed information without debugging.
    - Added a statement about 'uncertain' CVwR if nRR <12 in one of the
      full replicate 3-period designs (acc. to the EMA's Q&A Rev. 12).
    - Added a statement if nTR <12. Suggested by MT.
    - Added license info and disclaimer (paranoia).
    - Cosmetics: Result-file UTF-8 encoded.
    - Variable and decimal sep's for reading CSV-files can be specified.
      Defaults ";" and "."

Version 0.92
Released to collaborators 2016-12-14
    - Bug with wrong Miss.per for data sets with  NA='.' fixed. [MT]
    - If path does not exist, R's working directory is used with warning.
      [MT]

Version 0.91
Released to collaborators 2016-12-14
    - Vectorized Miss.seq and Miss.per in get.data, unnecessary function
      complete() removed. [MT]
    - The line 'names(Miss.per)' is removed (not used in output. [MT]

Version 0.90
Released to collaborators 2016-12-14
    - Added DF of the treatment difference to the output.
    - Removed lmer/lmerTest (was called by option=1 in previous versions),
      since Satterthwaite's DF are not compliant with the Q&A document.
Version 0.83
Released to collaborators 2016-12-11
    - Added function complete() to construct a  data.frame of complete
      data based on the subjects and design. Called by get.data() to
      calculate the number of missing values independent whether the DS
      contains this information (NAs in 'PK') or not.
      New variable 'Miss.seq': Missings / sequence.
      New variable 'Miss.per': Missings / period.
      TODO: vectorize!

Version 0.82
Released to collaborators 2016-12-10
    - Input checking:
      Converts variable names (except 'PK' and 'logPK') to /lower/ case.
      Stops if variables are not coded as 'subject', 'period', 'sequence',
      and 'treatment'. Stops if treatments are not coded as 'R' and 'T'.
      Stops if the number of sequences and/or periods does not match the
      specified design.
    - Changed the default in method.B() from option=1 to option=2. No
      DDFM is specified in the Q&A's SAS-code. Hence, the default
      DDFM=CONTAIN is applied. lme4/lmerTest (option=1) - like Phoenix by
      default - uses Satterthwaite's DF.
    - Added na.action=na.omit to lme() since the default (na.fail) stops
      the model.
    - Returns number of missings / sequence (currently only for NAs).
      Improve!

Version 0.81
Released to collaborators 2016-12-09
    - Bug with packages checking fixed. [MT]
    - (.) removed before names of variables. [MT]

Version 0.8
Released to collaborators 2016-12-09
    - Bug in the calculation of Nsub.seq fixed. [MT]
    - To the list of packages lme4 is added. It was implied subroutine
      call from lmerTest. [MT]
    - To the file name the name of used package is added for method.B()
      (_lmer or _lme). [MT]
    - '/' is added to the path if not present. [MT]

Version 0.7
Released to collaborators and beta-tester Jiri Hofmann 2016-12-07
    - Bug-fix in BE-assessment corrected (testing both res$CI and res$GMR
      instead of unique().
    - Bug in the calculation of Nsub.seq! DA12 (with N=77) gives 149 in
      both sequences.

Version 0.6
Released to collaborators 2016-12-02
    - sequence+subject%in%sequence+period according to the Q&A and the
      setup in SAS and Phoenix. Note that nested subjects are superfluous.
      The more simple model subject+period gives exactly the same residual
      error!

Version 0.5
Released to collaborators 2016-11-28
    - Added import format XLS(X). Requires package 'readxl'.
      Cave: If the sheet(s) contains a commentary header, in the argument
      'skip' the number of rows /not/ to be used must be given.

Version 0.4
Released to collaborators 2016-11-27
    - New function CV.calc() as suggested by DL. Moved the calculations
      from get.data(). Adapted calls in method.A() and method.B().
    - Vectorized Nsub.seq [MT].

Version 0.3
Released to collaborators 2016-11-26
    - Results of iteratively adj. alpha printed.  Throws a warning if
      adjust=TRUE for an unsupported design.
    - Bug corrected in selecting subjects with RR [MT].
    - Added number of subjects/sequence and check for balance (not
      vectorized yet).

Version 0.2
Released to collaborators 2016-11-24
    - Added log half-width to the data.frame 'res'.
    - New argument 'logtrans' (default TRUE). If TRUE, the raw data (PK)
      are internally log-transformed. If FALSE the already log-transformed
      data (logPK) will be used.
    - Data can now be provided /without/ the column logPK. If erroneously
      a call is made with logtrans=FALSE, the code switches to internal
      log-transformation (as if logtrans=TRUE would have been called) and
      throws a warning.
    - Use package PowerTOST for assessment of the  Type I Error and
      (optional) adjustment of alpha (only 'Method A'). New argument
      (default FALSE). Results only to the console.  Changed hard-coded
      parts to the respective functions of PowerTOST.

Version 0.1
Released to collaborators 2016-11-23
    - Added coding for Method B by nlme. [MT]
    - Using intervals() instead of a hard-coded confidence interval [DL].
    - New arguments 'print' (default TRUE) and 'details' (default FALSE).
      x <- foo(..., print=FALSE, details=TRUE) provides a data.frame of
      results with 7 significant digits.
    - New argument 'option' (1 or 2) in method.B().
      1 (default) evaluates by 'lmerTest' and 2 by 'nlme'.

Version 0.0
Released to collaborators 2016-11-22
    - New [HS]. All changes done by [HS] if not stated otherwise.
