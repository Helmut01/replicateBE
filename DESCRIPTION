Description: Performs comparative bioavailability-calculations for the
             EMA’s Average Bioequivalence with Expanding Limits (ABEL).
             Implemented are ‘Method A’ and ‘Method B’, detection of
             outliers. If the design allows, assessment of the empiric
             Type I Error and iteratively adjusting a to preserve the
             consumer risk.
             Average Bioequivalence (ABE) - optionally with tighter
             (EMA: NTIDs) or wider limits (GCC: Cmax) - is implemented
             as well.
